    abstract: |
      Planning scan routes with prior knowledge can improve scan data quality and completeness. This paper presents a BIM-enabled approach to optimize quadruped robot navigation for automated 3D scanning. The BIM data schema is enriched with IndoorGML, integrating building geometry with spatial data to establish an indoor navigation model describing multi-scale spatial topological networks. This navigation model, which includes an enhanced greedy algorithm, optimizes quadruped robot scanning positions and traversal sequences. The scan planning optimization outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in computational efficiency, coverage, and scan point count. The BIM-enabled approach is validated on ROS and in real-world conditions with a 3D LiDAR sensor integrated with a quadruped robot. The robotic scans achieve visible coverage of 70-90% of the structure, with a fluctuation of 0.006-0.021mm compared to traditional laser scans. The findings demonstrate robotic scans as a viable way of obtaining complete and accurate point clouds, reducing human effort in traditional scanning.


## About Me
Dr. Vincent Gan is an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Previously, he served as a Research Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Visiting Lecturer at Imperial College London, and Guest Lecturer at University College London. He holds bachelor’s degrees in engineering management and architecture, an MSc and PhD in Civil Engineering, and certifications from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Machine Learning and Data-driven Decision Making, and a Visiting Researcher at Purdue University. Dr. Gan's research focuses on building informatics and automation technologies. At NUS, he established the Building Informatics and Automation Lab, dedicated to developing digital methods based on robotics, advanced 3D modelling, and computational optimisation for the built environment. He serves as Deputy Director of both the Centre for 5G Digital Building Technology and the Centre for Project and Facilities Management. In 2023, he was recognised as one of the Top 2% Scientists Worldwide in a study by Stanford University.
His current effort involves integrating robotic scanning and scan-to-BIM techniques for automated data capture and 3D digital modelling of buildings and infrastructures, along with computational optimisation for generative (re)design to refine decision-making in new construction. He is the PI and co-PI of S$2.2M in scientific research grants and industry collaboration projects. He has authored over 79 peer-reviewed scholarly articles in esteemed journals, including Automation in Construction, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, Advanced Engineering Informatics, Applied Energy, and Building and Environment. He has received several international awards and honours in recognition of his research, notable among these are High Commendation Research Award by HKIPM, Structural Excellence Award by HKIE, OpenBIM/OpenGIS Grand Award by buildingSmart (HK), Best Paper Awards including ICCBEI2013, ICCEPM2017/2020 and IPC2020.
His teaching interests encompass fundamental engineering management topics such as Project Cost Management and Advanced Measurement, as well as advanced digitalisation topics like Digital Construction and AI for the Built Environment. He is dedicated to innovative pedagogy for teaching digital methods and has received the College Teaching Excellence Award at NUS.
